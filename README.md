### Music Genre Classification Using Deep Learning
## Member: Nguyen Tran
Description: Implement a deep learning model to classify music based on genre. There are currently 10 genres right now, but with more data the classification task will be broaden. Ultimate goal is to build a music generating app. 

## Usage:
run dataload.ipynb to generate data pickle files, then run the model.ipynb to generate the model. 

## notice 
Right now there is not enough seperate test set yet, I am still crawling more.
